# Versioning and Changelog

The changelog is prepared manually immediately before a release. Each changelog entry should follow this structure:

```
## 2.0.0 - 2017-04-20
### Breaking changes
* A change ([#100](https://github.com/shopify/polaris/pull/100))
```

The possible groups in which to categorize changes are:

* Breaking changes
* Markup changes
* Enhancements (new variations, accessibility improvements, etc.)
* Design updates (non-breaking design changes implemented in code)
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Dependency upgrades
* Style guide
* Sketch UIKit (design changes without matching implementations)
* Chores (non-documentation tasks on the repo itself)

## Versioning scheme

Because we expose both React components (for which the markup, including class names, is an implementation detail) and static CSS/Sass builds, the versioning scheme for Polaris is somewhat unusual. The following sections detail what kinds of changes result in each of major, minor, and patch version bumps:

### Major
* Removal of a component
* Removal of a prop from a component
* Change to the type accepted for a prop
* Breaking changes to minimum version of dependencies
* Breaking changes to Sass functions and mixins

### Minor
* Breaking change to the HTML generated by a component, including addition, removal, or renaming of classes
* New component
* New prop for a component
* Additional type accepted for a prop
* Changes to the UI Kit that do not result in breaking changes

### Patch
* Bug fixes that do not result in breaking changes to markup
* Non-breaking changes to minimum version of dependencies
