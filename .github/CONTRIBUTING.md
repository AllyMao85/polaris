### Feature requests

ðŸŒŸ Before requesting a feature, search the [existing feature requests](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature+request%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). You can [:+1: upvote](https://help.github.com/articles/about-conversations-on-github/) feature requests to help the Polaris team set priorities. If a feature request is closed, you can still upvote! A closed feature request means itâ€™s not something weâ€™re currently working on, but we take all your input into account when planning what to work on next.
